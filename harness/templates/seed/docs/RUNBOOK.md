# RUNBOOK — maintenance playbook

<!--
SEED TEMPLATE (AMH). Yours from the moment it is copied. Process docs are code: if a playbook
is wrong, stale or missing the case you just handled, fixing it is part of that change, not a
follow-up. For a small repo, folding this file into the constitution is a legitimate
simplification — split it out when the playbooks multiply.
-->

Entry point for changing the system. Pick the playbook matching your task, read the reference
docs it names, then do the work. **Code + {{IMMUTABLE_FIXTURES}} are ground truth**; where any
doc disagrees with the code, trust the code (and fix the doc).

## Where logic lives

{{MODULE_MAP — the same shape as the constitution's, one level more detail.}}

## Reference-doc index

## Change-type playbooks

Each: *when · read first · code to touch · obligations · acceptance · record it.*

### 1. {{CHANGE_TYPE, e.g. "Bug fix"}}

- **Read first:** {{reference docs + related ledger rows}}
- **Steps / code:** {{where the change goes — e.g. reproduce → failing test first → fix so it
  conforms to the fixtures (never edit a fixture to pass) → ladder → adversarial review if the
  diff touches {{UNTESTED_GLUE_AREAS}}}}
- **Acceptance:** {{the binary gate — which ladder rungs}}
- **Record:** {{STATE changelog line; ledger row if durable; which reference doc to update}}

{{Repeat for each recurring change type: feature, config/schema change, dependency or
platform bump (two reviewable commits: forward-compat first, behaviour flip second), release
cut (version invariants; the owner does the tagging), etc.}}

## Session discipline (BINDING for every session)

1. **Strictly sequential.** No parallel subagents; one unit of work at a time. Parallel agents
   on one repo have burned whole usage windows.
2. **Small, shippable units.** About one focused hour, independently shippable, each with a
   hard **binary** acceptance check — never "looks right".
3. **Checkpoint invariant.** Every unit ends: acceptance green → STATE changelog line →
   commit → push. Never start a second unit on top of an uncommitted first. Assume the session
   dies at any moment; an interrupted session must lose at most the unit in flight.
4. **You are the last reviewer.** The review protocols below are mandatory. There is no
   stronger pass behind you.
5. **Multi-unit work** persists an owner-approved plan file plus a STATE checklist; segments
   run sequentially and each ends shippable; delete the plan file at the end — by then its
   durable content lives in changelog lines and ledger rows. Code cites ledger rows, never
   plans: plans die, the ledger does not.
6. **Recovery (bounded).** If the unit in flight has gone wrong: reset to the last green
   checkpoint, re-run the ladder to confirm green, re-attempt smaller — recording any durable
   lesson first. Recovery is not infinite: if the SAME blocker survives a second
   reset-and-retry with no real progress, stop. Reset once more to green (never end a unit
   red), record the blocker in the Owner queue, commit and push so the record survives session
   death, and end the unit. A gate that will not go green is either a real fix you are missing
   — diagnose it, do not just re-run it — or an owner fork. Neither is solved by burning the
   usage window re-running a script. The stop is for a genuinely stuck blocker, never cover
   for abandoning a failure you could diagnose. Pushed checkpoints are immutable; recovery
   never rewrites pushed history.
7. **Ask, don't assume.** Forks that are (a) irreversible or expensive to unwind (schema
   migration, deleting a feature, renaming a public surface), (b) user-visible behaviour with
   no spec to appeal to, (c) version-semantics ambiguous (readable as minor or major), or (d)
   process-reshaping (changes how the owner works, not just the code) are the OWNER's: stop at
   the last green checkpoint, record the fork with options and your recommendation under
   STATE → Owner queue → Open questions, then move to independent work. Genuinely unsure
   whether something is a fork? Treat it as one — the queue entry already carries your
   recommendation, so escalation costs the owner one read, while a wrong guess can cost a
   segment. Routine engineering judgement inside a unit's stated scope is NOT a fork. The
   final chat message restates the Owner queue.
8. **Verification disclosure.** Every commit body states what was actually verified (which
   ladder rungs and tests ran) and names what could NOT be verified locally. Disclosure of
   real actions, addressed to a human — never something a gate consumes.

## Adversarial review protocol (MANDATORY for {{UNTESTED_GLUE_AREAS}} diffs)

Test suites cannot see all code. After the ladder is green, hand the FULL diff to a
**fresh-context** reviewer (subagent or clean invocation) — given the diff, this checklist and
tree access, but NOT the authoring context, which is anchored on its own rationale and
predisposed to accept it. Scale the reviewer's model tier to the diff: small mechanical change
→ light tier; large or glue-heavy → the strongest available. Self-review is the fallback only
where no fresh context can be spawned.

Hunt these proven bug classes — each one a real shipped bug from this repo's ledger; append
new classes as the ledger grows:

- {{BUG_CLASS + its ledger citation}}

If the pass finds nothing, say so in the commit body ("adversarial pass: clean"); if it finds
something, fix it before the commit and ledger anything durable. That verdict is disclosure to
a human reader, not evidence the pass happened — legitimate only because nothing consumes it.
Never let a guard, a CI step or a merge checklist start requiring the string; a self-report
that gates anything is passed by typing. When a class turns out to be
mechanically testable, encode it as a regression test and retire it from this list — the pass
holds only what the tests cannot see.

## Rule-review protocol (MANDATORY for binding-rule and guard diffs)

Diffs changing the harness's legislation — the constitution, this runbook's protocols, guard
semantics AND their fixture suite, the mechanical rail scripts (a silently weakened rail is a
weakened rail), the session bootstrap, ledger preambles, adapter permission rails — get the
same fresh-context pass at the **strongest tier regardless of diff size**: a three-line rule
edit can carry a semantic bomb, and a bad rule manufactures defects in every future session
that obeys it. **No self-review fallback:** a harness that cannot spawn a fresh context parks
the rule change for the human rather than reviewing its own legislation. Routine state-file
edits are exempt, EXCEPT the state file's rule-bearing sections (its length-guard preamble,
its decided non-items).

The reviewer hunts these rule bug classes (seed the exemplars from your own ledger as they
occur):

- **rule contradiction** — the new rule against an existing binding rule;
- **prose/guard lockstep drift** — a number or behaviour stated in prose diverging from the
  guard constant or logic that enforces it;
- **Goodhart-ability** — the rule can be satisfied while defeating its intent;
- **enforcement asymmetry** — prose implies a check no guard performs (say "prose-only", or
  add the check);
- **citation validity** — cited ledger entries exist AND actually support the claim (the
  citation guard scans code, not doc prose — this half is checked only here);
- **agent-agnosticism regression** — the rule silently assumes one agent's machinery,
  filenames or environment variables.

Verdict in the commit body. The ladder's rule-file tripwire only *surfaces* that this protocol
applies; reviewer attention is the enforcement. One level of meta only: the reviewer reports,
the session triages, the human arbitrates. Nobody reviews the reviewer.

## Incident: leaked credential

Containment outranks the checkpoint invariant.

1. **Stop.** Never repeat the value again — not in STATE, the ledger, chat or a diff. Refer to
   it by key name only.
2. **Owner queue immediately:** key name, where it landed (SHA / file / log), exposure window.
   Push nothing new containing it.
3. **The owner rotates the credential FIRST.** Rotation is what ends the exposure; the value
   stays burned even after cleanup.
4. **Then** the owner decides on a history rewrite — the ONE sanctioned exception to
   never-rewriting-pushed-history, scoped to removing the secret, **owner-decided AND
   owner-executed**. An agent never runs the rewrite: the deny rail stays for agents, and the
   owner lifts it for themselves.
5. **Afterward:** a ledger row, and if a guard or deny rail could have caught it, add one with
   a fixture test.

## Acceptance ladder

**One command: `scripts/ladder.sh`** — fast pre-flight guards, then the full task set in one
invocation. CI's verification step invokes THIS script, so there is no hand-maintained
lockstep between what the agent runs and what CI runs. `--guards-only` covers docs-only
changes in seconds.

## When CI fails (workflow vs code)

The local ladder and CI run the same script, so CI-red with local-green means environment, not
code. Triage: (1) read the failing log — a real failure (fix the code), a toolchain mismatch
(fix the workflow, in the same PR), or a flake (re-run once; never "fix" code for a flake).
(2) Never weaken a gate to get green. (3) Real but out of scope: say so, with the log excerpt.

## Self-adaptation — keep this runbook useful

If this runbook lacks what you need: consult the ledger and the archive, record durable facts
as ledger rows, and if a playbook is wrong, stale or missing the case you just handled, **fix
this runbook in the same change.** Treat it as code.

Self-adaptation covers *operational* content — playbooks, the doc index, module maps,
commands. *Binding* rules (session discipline, the review protocols, guard semantics, git and
permission policy) are never self-adaptation: they go through the rule-review protocol, and
process-reshaping changes go through the Owner queue (discipline 7).
